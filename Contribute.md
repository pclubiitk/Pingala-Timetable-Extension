## How to Contribute
We welcome your input ! However, to keep the project organized and ensure every feature fits the vision of the extension, we follow a specific process. Please do not open a Pull Request (PR) without following these steps first.

### 1. Find or Create an Issue
Before you start coding, check the Issues tab to see if the feature or bug you want to work on is already being discussed. If not, open a new issue with a proper description of the feature requirements.

### 2. Discuss Your Approach
This is a mandatory step. Before implementing any solution:

 - Comment on the issue you created/found.
 - Clearly state your intended technical approach (e.g., which Chrome APIs you plan to use, how you'll modify the storage logic, etc.).
- Wait for approval from the maintainer. We want to make sure the work is not redundant and follows the project's architecture.



### 3. Implementation and PR
Once your idea is approved , implement the changes in a new branch. Ensure your code doesn't break existing functionality (test it in Developer Mode). Submit your PR with a link to the original issue.

We do not accept Pull Requests that consist of raw, unverified, or context-blind code generated by AI tools. Before any implementation begins, you are formally required to engage in a technical architectural review as stated above.

## Contribution Rules
No "Drive-by" PRs: PRs submitted without a prior approved discussion will likely be closed.

Documentation: Update any relevant README or help sections if you add a new feature.
